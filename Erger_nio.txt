- Cannot spawn a task from an existing task (in planned list) - 1m
- Cannot go to topic/planned task instance from the other one - 1m

Maybe: permanent link to a certain task (but that's also silly if there is no server side routing)

- Does not show exactly what the last time of saving/loading/modification was. (Can be a table with: Last saved: ... , Last modified: ..., Last loaded ... -1m

- The topic text width will mess up the whole layout if the text is too long - 1m

- I'm really missing internal dependencies/positively correlated functions - 1m
 (This really reduces load on how many tasks I should look into)


- Reduce cognitive load - 2M
-- Do not show any tasks that are finished
-- Do not show any repeated tasks that should not be redone in a while
-- Do not show any tasks that are blocked (by another task)
-- Do not show any tasks that would be easier (by doing another task)
-- Do not show any task that is currently waiting (by a meeting/other person/event/appointment)
-- Do not show any task that is currently "Testing for completion"
-- Show tasks that are important


- Does not unselect items after dragging in Topic View/does not show the selection after dragging in Topic View - 1m

- Accidentally made a duplicate task - 1m

- To reduce cognitive load, there should be a way that I can block out anything that I cannot do. Also, the hierarchical way of thinking is real nice. I need to think of a workflow of how this should work. I think the best way would be to plan in a supertask, but only have to plan in the subtasks the moment it can be actually done? Or when it becomes a priority. It's like: Higher task = Maintain property. Would be relatively important, but the details are not important until something is broken and I need it.

- When looking through the system when it's filtered, it's easy to forget the state of the filtering (better feedback on filtering) - 1m
