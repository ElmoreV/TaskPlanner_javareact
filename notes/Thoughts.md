## Properties of tasks

### General overview

See completion of a task as a search algorithm. There are many paths to take to an end point. And in completion of a task, there are many ways to complete a task. I first confused the way to complete a task and the goal of a task. They look and taste almost the same, but are different in some fundamental ways, which I try to find here.

Example goals that confuse me:

- "Improve yourself for 1 year"
- "Make the world a better place"
- "Sleep 8 hours every day"


Actions that confuse me:

- "Write for 2 hours"
- "Change for 2 hours?"


Dimensions of a task:

- Why is the task there?
- Product/Outcome or system/process based?
- What are tasks, user stories?
- Does it generate value?
- How does it relate to planning scheduling?
- How does it related to change?
- How is it rewarded?
- Way to complete it?
- Scheduled?
-

**Threshold-based/activity** 

- Needs a target to give a whole picture.
- Will never really be *done* unless a target (or time span) is connected to it.
- Working on this task will complete it. (Avoiding not working)
- Completion might be clear (I did the action 50% of the time planned), but progress is not (you will never reach target.)
 You can never say you will never cross the threshold. Just say it's unlikely.)
- Complexity here is the effort expended for doing the task
	+ I'm unsure about how this factors in
- There may be many ways/paths/implementations from A to B



**Goals**

- If you complete this, you are *done*.
- Working on this task may not complete it.
- Like: Being paid for the job finished
- Relatively unknown if reached within time/budget goal.
- Needs actions/processes to complete goal.
- Fits very well with a deadline
- Can either be all-or-nothing or percentages with subgoals or using some time/effort estimation.



### Purpose vs implementation

It's simple, the purpose is the supertask, the implementation is the subtask. 

Example:

- Buy a car
	+ Look around for a car for 2 hours online
		* Go on the internet
			- Walk around and search laptop
			- Find my laptop
			- Open laptop
			- Open browser
		* Go to car searching website
			- ....
		* ...
	+ Go to car dealer
	+ ...
	
Example 2:

- I want to continuously improve
	+ Reflect on systems and activities every week
		* Remember what I have done
		* ...


It can be done in a sentence:

"I need to reflect every week to continuously improve" or "I want to continuously improve, so I need to reflect ... every week."



#### Root topics/root goals

Product-based work, will try to finish the product and make as many of the with a tradeoff (time/schedule/fast)/(budget/cheap/money)/(scope=quantity+quality=good).


#### Subtasks

It can be easily misused to allow goals and actions to be intermixed.

It would need to be called subgoals and subprocesses/actions.


### Target values vs. thresholds (ways to complete a goal)

#### Target values


#### Thresholds


Goals are complete when conditions are met.

Conditions can be:

- continuous (measuring an objective (value) or subjective (opinion) metric along a time span)
- discrete (measuring a metric at a snapshot)

Every goal can be completely decomposed in continuous or densely repeated discrete subgoals. 

Deadline is another thing: it described when it's impossible to complete.



Goals can be completed:

- Timing: unspecified - when all the subtasks are done
- *Timing: cont. limited - when a subtask has been going on for as long as the time span'*
- Timing: cont. infinity - when all subtasks are being completed until its impossible


### Static and changing goals


There is something fishy here. There is something about goals and actions and infinity/neverending that doesn't seem right. There is a part of meaning and purpose in there. A part of doing vs. wanting. A parts of the process as the goal. Never the goal as the process. Is there an overarching framework? Is the RL framework a good framework for this?

What I was seeing were 2 things:

- The achieving of a target value vs. the avoiding of a threshold/a limit/failing a condition.
- The threshold value being static or changing.


- 'Goals' were the achieving of a threshold/target
	+ Add a button to the UI (target = verifiable: I can click button)
	+ Improve cardio by 3% every week (target = now*103%)
	+ The product is sold (target = transaction completed)
- 'Actions' were the avoiding of a threshold/limit
	+ 
	+ Improve cardio every week (avoid the *changing* threshold of good you were are cardio before)
	+ Improve anything (avoid the ***changing*** threshold of being worse than before)
	
- Some were confusing, because they are kind of both.
	+ Sleep for 8 hours
		* Target to reach: 8 hours
		* Threshold to avoid: being awake
	+ Stay working on this task for 2 hours (avoid the 'don't work' threshold)
		* Target to reach: 2 hours
		* Threshold to avoid: not working
	+ Researching internet to search a good framework
		* Target to reach: find a good framework
		* Threshold to avoid: not researching internet
				
I have the feeling that avoiding threshold tasks and changing threshold tasks are the most tiring/exhausting.
It depends, if avoiding the threshold is the status quo (don't work, don't do drugs), it's relatively easy. However, during an addiction, actually the (don't do drugs) is the more difficult threshold to avoid. So threshold-based tasks that you are already above naturally are easy. Threshold based tasks that you do not meet are definitely more difficult. First you need to hit a target and then keep it.

#### Improvability

##### TODO

### Verifiability/testability of goals

#### TODO

### Progression (how to measure)

#### TODO

### Duration

#### TODO

#### Complexity

Complexity makes the amount of time and effort spent more difficult to estimate. It might not be longer, but the actual time may just be more off from the estimated time.

#### Motivation/effort

Some tasks are just more difficult to do

- Require focus
- Require effort
- Are not mentally stimulating
- Take too long without seeing results.

#### Reward/Punishment

- Satisfaction
- Completion of a supertask

### Repetition

- Repeated - when the subtasks are done every time
- Repeated inf. - when the subtasks are done every time until it's impossible.


Can be:

- Continuous limited (until done/ reach target)
- *Continuous limited (time span/ will not reach target)*
- Continuous infinity (until impossible / never reach target)

Repeated limited (every week, for a year):
- Repeated (every week until done)
- Repeated + cont. limited (Monday for 2h, every week)

Repeated unlimited (every week, until impossible):
- Repeated unlimited (every day, do this)
- Repeated unlimited + deadline (before Monday, every week)
- Repeated unlimited + cont. limited (Monday for 2h, every week)


Or a hybrid

Examples:

- "I want to get a Spanish B2 certificate"
- *"I want to practice Spanish 2 hours" (time span)*
- "I want to practice Spanish until I die" (until impossible)
- "I want to practice Spanish every Monday" (repeated + time span

### SMART goals

- Specific (testable: true/false result. Not a maybe result.)
- Measurable/trackable
- Attainable/achievable/realistic/reasonable/resourced (realistic given the resources (skills/budget/time))
- Relevant/strategic (purposeful/contextual)
- Time-limited/based/oriented/bound/sensitive/frame

- Responsibility/assignable/agreed
- Emotions: aggressive/ambitious/motivating

- Results-based vs. action-oriented


## Relations between tasks

### Dependencies (internal + external)

- Direct dependency, cannot do one without the first having happened (by protocol or causally)
- Correlation (one will complete easier when the other has been done, e.g. automating one part)
- Anticorrelation (if one is completed, the other one is less important/unnecessary)
- Mutually exclusive (if one will be done, the other one will be impossible (some contrained resource, like money, time, etc.)


#### Internal

Internal dependencies: tasks are dependent on each before they are ready to start.

The dependencies I know of are:

- Branching paths: doing one path might make the other path unrewarded work
	+ To get a girlfriend, you either
		* go outside and find a girlfriend
		* go online and find an online girlfriend
- Causal dependencies: completing one task is necessary for the other task
	+ You first need to go outside to hug a tree
- Diminishing returns: doing the other task first would be more efficient (organizing/planning/automation)
	+ Automating task planning, would reduce the time spent planning tasks, but you need to first develop the task planning
- Informational dependencies: one task might be irrelevant if the other task is done
	+ If I understand how to make a wheel, I don't need to reinvent it
- 

Async tasks:

- Task 2 cannot be started when Task 1 is not finished (Singleton resource from task 1)
- Task 2 cannot be finished until Task 1 is finished (Resource from task 1 dependent)
- Task 2 cannot be started when Task 1 is not started (Resource from task 1 dependent.)
- Task 2 cannot be finished when Task 1 is not started. (Must not reach target tasks)

- Also a way of asynchronous tasking will make the dependence weirder (partial task frees up another task.)




#### External

External dependencies: tasks are dependent on resources (physical, digital or informational) of another person until they are ready to start.





### Categorization


#### Topics vs. Super/subtasks

It seems like every task will have a certain influence on certain other tasks. These interrelations are often captured in topics. If there is some overarching goal or process, you could also subdivide it in there.



- The main goal/purpose it is working towards
	- Working = goal of other people to get money for yourself to do interesting stuff on the side/have a retirement
- What is the activity you are doing (cycling, programming, planning, sleeping, gaming, reading, mindmapping, buying something)
- Who is involved? (parents, friends, only you, colleagues)
- What condition is necessary for it to be done (near a computer, outside, inside, during the day, during the night, near my tools, shops need to be open, high/low motivation, high/low stress)

So to categorize tasks, there are different possibilities:
1. Overarching Goals
2. Overarching System or Process
2. Projects that are helped by this task
3. Tasks that are dependent on each other (the second one relies on the completion of the first)
4. Correlated tasks (improving one automatically improves the other)
5. Type of action the task requires (learning/reading/going outside)
6. People involved in the task


### Priorities


## Task workflows

### Planning


### Scheduling

#### Unexpected events


### How can I do meta-planning well in the taskplanner? Continuous task-list? What would be a good flow?


#### Replanning

1. Clear all completed(is also unscheduled) items from the planned list
2. Unschedule all (really unscheduled) items
3. Unplan/resort a few tasks from the bottom of the planned list
3. Add all task and time-planning tasks from the list
4. Collect all tasks
5. Prioritize tasks by sorting them
6. Schedule tasks

#### Rescheduling

1. Items that were not completed: unschedule or Impossible them
2. Reprioritize them
3. Reschedule tasks for until next Replanning

#### Explanation

Note: scheduling is only a thing for a time-span. You can schedule a day, a week. But after a while, the schedule is ruined. What do you do? You create a new schedule, but some tasks are still scheduled, some are not. Do you reschedule everything? You need an end horizon for this maybe. How do you handle repeated items within the time span?

The planning view is a snapshot of what needs to be done. The topic view is a snapshot of how or why it needs to be done. The scheduling would be a when does it need to be done. The scheduling part is the most volatile view, then the planning view, then the topic view.


### How is 'improving a process' formulated as a task?

## Impossible tasks

What ways can a task become impossible to do?

- Outside of the possible times (season, time of day, month)
- Conditions are not available (no rain, no sun)
- People unavailable

There is also the possilbity of a task becoming irrelevant

- Higher goal has changed
