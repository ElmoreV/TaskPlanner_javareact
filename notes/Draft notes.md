If I move a task within a topic, the order should change, but the topic shouldn't

If I move a task to another topic, the order of the tasks in hte old topic might change, and the order of the tasks in the new topic might change, and the task that is moved will probably also have a new order within that topic.

This is hard in local and global ordering.

Moving a topic keeps the ordering of the tasks within constant, this is hard with global ordering, but easy with local ordering.
