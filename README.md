# TaskPlanner

> This React App allows you to plan tasks in a by-topic view, a weekly view and a daily view simultaneously.


![Example of a per topic view](Example_1.png)

## Usage

Download the code or fork the repository and git clone it to your computer.

To install the necessary scripts, first run

```zsh
npm install
```


Then to collect all the npm/node packages, use:

``` 
npm run build
```

Subsequently, to run the server on the localhost, use:

```
npm run start
```

and it will start a server on localhost:3000

## Features

- A by-topic view of all tasks. Tasks can be in multiple topic. Tasks can have subtasks. Topics can have subtopics.
- A weekly view, where you can collect all tasks to be done this week. Can support tasks that are not visible in the by-topic view.
- A daily view, where you can collect all tasks in a timed fashion. Can also support tasks not visible in the weekly and by-topic view.


## Future plans

The todo-list is self-hosted in the problem. In the future it will output a markdown file, that will be automatically shown in the GitHub pages. For now, it is:
- [x] Make tasks draggeable/moveable
- [x] Add loading/saving interaction
- [x] Add weekly view
- [ ] Add daily view
- [ ] Animate collapse and dropdown








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
